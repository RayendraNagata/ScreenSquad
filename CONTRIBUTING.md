# Contributing to ScreenSquad

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ScreenSquad as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

* Use ESLint and Prettier configurations provided
* Follow React best practices
* Use TypeScript where possible
* Write meaningful commit messages

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
feat: add video sync feature
fix: resolve chat message ordering
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: restructure video store
test: add unit tests for auth
```
